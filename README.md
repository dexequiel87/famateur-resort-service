# Famateur Resorts Service - BETA

Spring Boot microservice for resorts management 

## Description

This project is meant to work as a microservice for resorts registrations as part of a system for assets booking. 
It is being used mainly for learning but it could be used for commercial purposes in the future. 
In here I will be implementing tools I currently use and tools I learn about. 
I will keep this project public for sharing knowledge and as a sample of my skills.
